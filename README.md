# Yadoro

Yet Another Pomodoro Timer. Because the other 10 pomodoro gems didn't cut it.

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'yadoro'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install yadoro

## Usage

To run the timer once without a message:

    $ yadoro

To run the timer with a message:

    $ yadoro start "your message here"

To run the timer once with a message:

    $ yadoro one "your message here"

## Development

This is a pet project and as such support is limited, but I plan to add support for TaskWarrior, and possibly move away from using `terminal-notifier` and `Thor`.
